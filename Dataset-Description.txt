Hypothesis
        The presence of smoking is related to increased fatal mortalities.
        Age directly correlates with increased fatal mortality.
        Being fully vaccinated decreases fatal mortality rates.


Dataset Description


For this project I will be utilizing two datasets, as aforementioned. Each data set has several columns. I don’t plan to use each column as there are so many and not all are applicable to answering my hypothesis questions. Below are some of the columns that I will be looking closer at and working with.
